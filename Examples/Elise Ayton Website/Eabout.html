			Elise Ayton was born on 29 April 1996 in Subiaco Perth, Western Australia, but has lived in Mandurah for most of her life. From a young age she has been interested in the arts and illustrative works, and has had a desire to create works of her own. While she mainly focuses on comic drawing and story ideas for this main project of hers, she also takes interest in drawing as a whole, sculpture, knitting, photography, and has a slight interest in video editing.  She takes inspiration from many places, but her biggest inspiration is the world around her, and historical events. She is currently studying Diploma level Visual Arts at North Metropolitan TAFE.
